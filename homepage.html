                    <img  src="images/RiversideResearchLogo.jpg">
                    <p>Riverside Research is a nonprofit organization that has been completing cutting edge 
                        research since it was established in 1967. Their research covers many fields which 
                        include radar, intelligence & surveillance, THz Imaging, and of course, Artificial 
                        Intelligence & Machine Learning. </p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>There are many different LLMs available, and all have varying degrees of competency in 
                    different fields. In order to maximize accuracy and efficiency, as well as minimize waste 
                    and cost, Riverside Research wants a way to choose the best LLM based on their various 
                    coding proficiencies. This will allow for programmers to have one convenient tool that 
                    will effectively act as the best LLM for each question, to make development in other projects faster.
                </p>
                <h3> Project Vision </h3>
                    <p>To research and develop an effective routing tool for utilizing the strengths of
                    multiple LLM models related to various software development processes and programming
                    categories.</p>
                <h3> Project Goals</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Comprise and present research on various LLM models regarding their effectiveness in
                            software development. </li>
                        <li> Develop a functional web application that utilizes the varying strengths of multiple LLM
                            models in software development. </li>
                    </ol>

            <h2> Sprint 1</h2>
                <h3>Sprint Goals</h3>
                    <p>Goals for this sprint surrounded mainly around completing reasearch in preperation for 
                    development. The major objectives were performing initial research on possible LLMs to use, as well as 
                    establishing and familiarizing ourselves with the technologies that would be used. </p>
                <h3>Development Progress</h3>
                    <p>In this sprint we successfully determined and familiarized outsevles with the relevant 
                        technologies for this project's tech stack. Some preliminary prototype applications were
                        developed as we learned Vue and FastAPI. Cursory research was conducted into viable LLMs, 
                        including Llama, Mistral, Granite, and CodeGen. </p>
                    <p>We also began some preliminary design work. Pictured below is a basic diagram detailing 
                        the user input and system output.</p>
